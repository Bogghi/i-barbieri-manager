# I barbiere manager

This project is a manager that has the scope of taking in appointment and handle then in store.

Tech stack chosed so far:

- Frontend: Flutter
- Backend(api): nodejs + expressjs for routing
- DB: mariaDB in a docker container (to implement)

I will probably host the project on VPN on ovh. To see if is deployable throw github actions.
